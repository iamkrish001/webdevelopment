      <h2>Receipe</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
        <span> Prepare the Chicken: </span>Wash the chicken pieces and pat them dry. If
          using bone-in pieces, they add more flavor to the curry.
        </li>
<br>
        <li>
            <span> Sauté the Aromatics: </span> Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add
          chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent. Then add minced
          garlic and grated ginger, stirring for a couple of minutes until
          fragrant.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <span>   Add Spices: </span> Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.
          Add turmeric powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, chili powder, and
          salt. Mix well and cook the spices for a few minutes until the oil
          starts to separate from the mixture.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <span>  Cook the Chicken: </span>Add the chicken pieces to the spice mixture,
          ensuring they are well coated. Cook for a few minutes until the
          chicken starts to brown slightly.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <span>   Simmer: </span>Pour in water (or chicken broth) enough to cover the chicken
          pieces. Bring it to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover
          the pan, and let it simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the
          chicken is cooked through and tender. If using coconut milk for a
          creamy texture, add it during this step.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <span>   Adjust Seasoning:</span> Taste and adjust the seasoning according to your
          preference. If the curry is too thick, add a little water to reach
          your desired consistency.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            <span>  Garnish and Serve:</span> Sprinkle garam masala over the curry and garnish
          with chopped cilantro leaves before serving. Serve hot with rice or
          naan bread.
